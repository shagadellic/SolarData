Crude way of mining data for my solar install, given they wont
give me access to their API.

Vendor website uses server side java to render pages and typical
scraping methods will not work. Hence this 'creative' approach. 

Prerequisite is a session cookie of the authenticated website.
Login to the site on the browser once, then put the url and the
site title into the config.xml file

  <Vendor>
    <URL>https://portal.vendor.com/ui/#/cgi/BLAH123</URL>
    <Title>Vendor Website Title - Google Chrome</Title>
  </Vendor>

Run miner.ps1 from task scheduler / cron. Suggest 10 minute loop.

The mined data can then be used by other apps when connected to the 
database. The charge_window column can be used by connected apps 
for logic status they wish to record. ie: 'charge car start / stop' 
etc

Requires sqlexpress
